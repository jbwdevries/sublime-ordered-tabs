Sublime plugin: Ordered Tabs
============================

This plugin helps you keep your tabs ordened.

Similar to SortTabs[1], but that package doesn't seem to be working and hasn't
been updated in about a decade.

How to install locally
----------------------
On Linux:

1. `cd ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/`
2. `ln -s ~/projects/github.com/jbwdevries/sublime-ordered-tabs/ OrderedTabs`
